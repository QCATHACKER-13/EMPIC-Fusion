Computational Simulation of a Nuclear Fusion Reaction Between Two Atomic Nuclei Bodies in an Electromagnetic Confinement
Using a Particle in Cell Method as standard for plasma, nuclear, and particle physics computational simulation.
Note: It's a confidential for new codes that I working with in my research project as part of my preparation for Master's Degree in Physics.
