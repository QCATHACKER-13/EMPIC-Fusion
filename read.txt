The primary law in the Philippines that governs data privacy is the Data Privacy Act of 2012, 
officially known as Republic Act No. 10173. This law regulates the processing of personal 
information in both the government and private sectors. While the Data Privacy Act of 2012 does 
not explicitly mention research information, it provides comprehensive provisions regarding the 
processing of personal information, including provisions for consent, security measures, and penalties 
for unauthorized access or disclosure of personal information. Under the Data Privacy Act, researchers 
and organizations processing personal information for research purposes are required to ensure 
the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the data they handle. Unauthorized access to or 
disclosure of research information without the researcher's consent could potentially violate the 
provisions of this law, especially if the information involved includes personal data.
